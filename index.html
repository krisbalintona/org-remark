<span id="Installation-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">1 Installation</h2>

<p>This package is available on:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/org-remark.html">GNU-ELPA</a> (releases only; equivalent to MELPA-Stable)
</li><li> <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/org-remark.html">GNU-devel ELPA</a> (unreleased development branch; equivalent to MELPA)
</li></ul>

<p>GNU ELPA should be already set up in your Emacs by default. If you wish to add GNU-devel ELPA, simply add its URL to <code>package-archives</code> like this:
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '(&quot;gnu-devel&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/&quot;) :append)
</pre></div>

<p>After installation, we suggest you put the setup below in your configuration.
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)

;; Optional if you would like to highlight websites via eww-mode
(with-eval-after-load 'eww
  (org-remark-eww-mode +1))
</pre></div>

<p><code>org-remark-global-tracking-mode</code> automatically turns on <code>org-remark-mode</code> when you open a file or website via EWW <a id="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a> that has a marginal notes file associated to it. This is useful to keep the location of your highlights correct across Emacs sessions after you shutdown Emacs.
</p>
<p>Unless you explicitly load <code>org</code> during Emacs initialization, we suggest to defer loading <code>org-remark</code> (thus there is no <code>(require 'org-remark)</code> in the example above). This is because it will also pull in <code>org</code>, which can slow down initialization. You can control the timing of loading <code>org-remark</code> by autoloading some commands in a similar way with the example keybindings below.
</p>
<p>Below are example keybindings you might like to consider:
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp">;; Key-bind `org-remark-mark' to global-map so that you can call it
;; globally before the library is loaded.

(define-key global-map (kbd &quot;C-c n m&quot;) #'org-remark-mark)

;; The rest of keybidings are done only on loading `org-remark'
(with-eval-after-load 'org-remark
  (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c n o&quot;) #'org-remark-open)
  (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c n ]&quot;) #'org-remark-view-next)
  (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c n [&quot;) #'org-remark-view-prev)
  (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c n r&quot;) #'org-remark-remove))

<span id="index-Marginal-notes-file"></span>

<p>Once you have installed and set it up (<a href="#Installation">Installation</a>), Org-remark is simple to use. Select a part of text and call <code>M-x org-remark-mark</code> to highlight it. You will see the selected text gets highlighted.
</p>
<p>The menu bar item &ldquo;Org-remark&rdquo; is available when you turn on <code>org-remark-mode</code>. It helps you discover Org-remark&rsquo;s main commands. If you use Emacs version 28 or newer, a context menu is also available by right-clicking your mouse. Turn on the Emacs built-in <code>context-menu-mode</code> to enable the context menu.
</p>
<p>To display the marginal notes for the highlight you have just marked, place your cursor on the highlight and call <code>M-x org-remark-open</code> or <code>M-x org-remark-view</code>. This will display a new buffer to the left of the current buffer you are editing. The <code>open</code> command takes the cursor to the marginal notes buffer for you to edit notes; whereas the <code>view</code> command keeps the cursor in the current buffer only to display the marginal notes. Both commands narrow the <strong>marginal notes file</strong> to the entry for the highlight under the cursor.  The marginal notes file is a normal Org file. Edit your notes just as you would do with any other Org files and save the buffer.

<span id="index-Menu-in-the-menu-bar"></span>
<span id="index-Context-menu"></span>

<p>After you have added a couple of highlights in the text, you can move through the highlights easily. Use <code>org-remark-view-next</code> and <code>org-remark-view-prev</code> to browse the marginal notes as you move from one highlight to another. They display the marginal notes on the side-window by default. Or use <code>org-remark-next</code> and <code>org-remark-prev</code> if you simply want to move to the next/previous highlight without displaying marginal notes for them.
</p>
<p>To make navigation easy, you can use define the same &ldquo;prefix key&rdquo; to Org-remark commands like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>C-c n o</code>: <code>org-remark-open</code>
</li><li> <code>C-c n ]</code>: <code>org-remark-view-next</code>
</li><li> <code>C-c n [</code>: <code>org-remark-view-prev</code>
</li><li> <code>C-c n r</code>: <code>org-remark-remove</code>
</li><li> <code>C-c n d</code>: <code>org-remark-delete</code>
</li></ul>

<p>The <code>C-c n</code> part is the prefix key common to all of them. If you set the keybindings like this, you can use <code>C-c n ]</code> once to view the next highlight and keep pressing a single key <code>]</code> or <code>[</code> to browse through the next/previous highlights. After you have reached the one you like to act on, press <code>o</code> to open it, <code>r</code> or <code>d</code> to remove/delete it.

<p><code>org-remark-create</code> is a macro that lets create your own custom pen functions. Org-remark comes with two additional pens that are created by default. Use them as examples to learn how to create your own.

</pre></div>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>Macro: <code>org-remark-create</code> label &amp;optional face properties</span></dt>
<dd><p>Create and register new highlighter pen functions. The newly created pen function will be registered to variable <code>org-remark-available-pens</code>.  It is used by <code>org-remark-change</code> as a selection list.
</p>
<p>LABEL is the name of the highlighter and mandatory.  The function will be named <code>org-remark-mark-LABEL</code>.
</p>
<p>The highlighter pen function will apply FACE to the selected region. FACE can be an anonymous face.  When FACE is nil, this macro uses the default face <code>org-remark-highlighter</code>.
</p>
<p>PROPERTIES is a plist of pairs of a symbol and value. Each highlighted text region will have a corresponding Org headline in the notes file, and it can have additional properties in the property drawer from the highlighter pen.  To do this, prefix property names with &ldquo;&lsquo;<samp>org-remark-</samp>&rsquo;&rdquo; or use &ldquo;&lsquo;<samp>CATEGORY</samp>&rsquo;&rdquo;.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<blockquote>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Don&rsquo;t use &lsquo;<samp>category</samp>&rsquo; (all lowercase, symbol) as a property &ndash; it&rsquo;s a special one for text properties. If you use it, the value also need to be a symbol; otherwise, you will get an error. You can use &lsquo;<samp>CATEGORY</samp>&rsquo; (all uppercase, symbol), which will result in adding &lsquo;<samp>CATEGORY</samp>&rsquo; with the value in the property drawer in marginal notes Org files.

<p>It is recommended that <code>org-remark-global-tracking-mode</code> be turned on as part of your Emacs initialization. This should be done before you start adding highlights in any file.
</p>
<p>Once you have added highlights to some files, quit Emacs, and re-start it, active <code>org-remark-global-tracking-mode</code> will automatically turn on <code>org-remark-mode</code> and load the highlights from your previous sessions for the files being globally tracked.
</p>
<p>Without this global minor mode, you would need to remember to activate <code>org-remark-mode</code> for each file where you add highlights and annotation. This is often unpractical.

<span id="index-Marginal-notes-file-1"></span>
<span id="index-Org_002dremark-properties-for-highlights-1"></span>

<p>When you mark a part of text with a highlighter pen function, Org-remark will automatically create a <strong>marginal notes file</strong>. By default, it will be named <code>marginalia.org</code> and created in the same directory as the file you are editing (<a href="#How-to-Change-Where-Marginal-Notes-File-is-Saved">How to Change Where Marginal Notes File is Saved</a> <a href="#Customizing">;Customizing</a>, <code>org-remark-notes-file-name</code>).
</p>
<p>The important thing to note is that Org-remark uses following properties in the property drawer of the headline to remember the highlights:
</p>
<ul>
<li> :org-remark-beg:
</li><li> :org-remark-end:
</li><li> :org-remark-id:
</li><li> :org-remark-label:
</li></ul>

<p>Essentially, the marginal notes file is a database in the plain text with using Org mode. As a plain text database, you can easily edit these properties manually if necessary. You can directly edit the marginal notes file as a normal Org file.
</p>
<p>The marginal notes file stores highlights and notes like this below; it is designed to organize highlights and notes for multiple files and multiple highlights.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">* File 1
** Highlight 1 in File 1
** Highlight 2 in File 1
[...]
* File 2
** Highlight 1 in File 2

<p>You can leave the marginal notes file as it is without writing any notes. In this case, the entries in marginal notes file simply save the locations of your highlighted text. After you quit Emacs,  re-start it, and visit the same source file, Org-remark uses this information to highlight the text again.
</p>
<p>In addition to the properties above that Org-remark reserves for itself, you can add your own custom properties and <code>CATEGORY</code> property. Use &ldquo;org-remark-&rdquo; as the prefix to the property names (or &ldquo;CATEGORY&rdquo;, which is the only exception), and Org-remark put them to the property drawer of highlight&rsquo;s headline entry in the marginal notes buffer. Define the custom properties in your own custom pen functions (for how to create your own pens, <a href="#How-to-Create-Custom-Highlighter-Pens">How to Create Custom Highlighter Pens</a>).

<span id="index-Echo-text-_002f-Tool-tip-on-the-Highlight"></span>

<p>When you display the marginal notes with <code>org-remark-view</code> or <code>org-remark-open</code> for a given highlight, Org-remark creates a cloned indirect buffer visiting the marginal notes file. By default, it is a dedicated side-window opened to the left part of the current frame, and it is named &lsquo;<samp>*marginal notes*</samp>&rsquo;. You can change the behavior of <code>display-buffer</code> function and the name of the buffer (<a href="#Customizing">Customizing</a>).
</p>
<p>Org-remark displays the marginal notes buffer narrowed to the highlight the cursor is on.
</p>
<p>After all the properties, you can freely write your notes for the highlight. Once you save the notes buffer, an excerpt of the text (currently up to 200 characters) gets updated back onto the highlight in the source buffer. You can hover your mouse over the highlight to see the excerpt displayed in the echo area (bottom of the screen) of Emacs. If you have <code>tooltip-mode</code> mode turned on, the excerpt is displayed as a took tip for the highlight <a id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

<span id="index-org_002dremark_002dnotes_002dfile_002dname"></span>

<p>The location of the marginal notes file is specified by user option <code>org-remark-notes-file-name</code> and its default is &ldquo;marginalia.org&rdquo;. This means the marginal notes file will reside in the same directory as the source files as a separate file.
</p>
<p>If you use the <code>customize</code> command to customize <code>org-remark-notes-file-name</code>, you will have an option to choose a &lsquo;<samp>File</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>Function</samp>&rsquo; (customization group <code>org-remark</code>). The default is &lsquo;<samp>File</samp>&rsquo; with the default &ldquo;marginal.org&rdquo; as noted above.  Use a string to specify the single file name; you can specify a relative path like the default or an absolute path.
</p>
<p>If you would like to dynamically change the location based on the file and various different conditions, select the function as an option.  The default function is <code>org-remark-notes-file-name-function</code>. It adds &lsquo;<samp>-notes.org</samp>&rsquo; as a suffix to the source file&rsquo;s name without the extension. For example, for a file named &lsquo;<samp>my-source-file.txt</samp>&rsquo;,  Org-remark will store highlights in  &lsquo;<samp>my-source-file-notes.org</samp>&rsquo;.  You can create your own function and use it.
</p>
<p>Some examples and use cases are listed below:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>Store Marginal Notes in the Source File</span></dt>
<dd><p>In order to use the source file also as the marginal notes file (storing the notes in the source file), you can set the built-in function <code>buffer-file-name</code> as the value of <code>org-remark-notes-file-name</code>. Note that you will need to ensure that the source files are an Org file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Create a marginal notes file for each source file and store all of them in a specific location</span></dt>
<dd><p>Create a custom function that returns an absolute file name per source file, and set <code>org-remark-notes-file-name</code> to the function name. It might look like this:
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(defun my/function ()
  (concat &quot;~/path/to/note-files/&quot;
          (file-name-base (org-remark-notes-file-name-function))

<span id="index-org_002dremark_002dsource_002dfile_002dname"></span>

<p>The marginal notes file stores the file name pointing back at source files. For example, a marginal notes entry for File1.txt might look like this example below.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">* File 1
:PROPERTIES:
:org-remark-file: path/to/File1.txt
:END:
** Highlight 1 in File 1
:PROPERTIES:
:[...other-properties]:
:org-remark-link: [[file:path/to/File1.txt::14]]
:END:
</pre></div>

<p>The level-1 headline named &ldquo;File 1&rdquo; records the file name of the source file &lsquo;<samp>path/to/File1.txt</samp>&rsquo;.  Similarly, the level-2 headline named &ldquo;Highlight 1 in File 1&rdquo; stores the link pointing back at the source file and the line number of the highlight.
</p>
<p>As you can see, both file names use a relative file name from the marginal notes file. This is the default setting of <code>org-remark-source-file-name</code>.
</p>
<p>You can customize the variable to use absolute file names, or to use a function of your choice. The function is called with a single argument: the absolute file name of source file.  The <code>default-directory</code> is temporarily set to the directory where the marginal notes file resides. If you choose to use relative file names, the relative path is computed from <code>default-directory</code>.

<span id="index-org_002dremark_002dremove"></span>
<span id="index-org_002dremark_002ddelete"></span>

<p>You can remove the highlight under the cursor with command &lsquo;org-remark-remove&lsquo;. This command does not delete the corresponding entry in the marginal notes file. This is intentional; Org-roam is conservative when it deletes anything that the user might have edited.
</p>
<p>If you wish to delete the entry and the highlight at the same time, pass a universal argument to &lsquo;org-remark-remove&lsquo; (e.g. by adding <code>C-u</code> before <code>M-x org-remark-remove</code>) or use <code>org-remark-delete</code>. <code>org-remark-delete</code> is identical with adding <code>C-u</code> to <code>org-remark-remove</code>.
</p>
<p>The delete function will prompt for confirmation if it detects any notes present in the corresponding entry for the highlight in question in the marginal notes buffer.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>Command <code>org-remark-remove</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Remove the highlight at point.
It will remove the highlight and the properties from the marginal notes file, but will keep the headline and annotations. This is to ensure to keep any notes you might have written intact.
You can let this command DELETE the entire heading subtree for the highlight along with the annotations you have written, by passing a universal argument with <code>C-u</code>. If you have done so by error, you could still <code>undo</code> it in the marginal notes buffer, but not from within the current buffer as adding and removing overlays are not part of the undo tree.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Command <code>org-remark-delete</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Delete the highlight at POINT and marginal notes for it.
This function will prompt for confirmation if there is any notes present in the marginal notes buffer.  When the marginal notes buffer is not displayed in the current frame, it will be temporarily displayed together with the prompt for the user to see the notes.
If there is no notes, this function will not prompt for confirmation and will remove the highlight and deletes the entry in the marginal notes buffer. This command is identical with passing a universal argument to &lsquo;org-remark-remove&rsquo;.

<dd><p>Toggle showing/hiding of highlights in current buffer.
If you would like to hide/show the highlights in the current buffer, it is recommended to use this command instead of <code>org-remark-mode</code>. This command only affects the display of the highlights and their locations are still kept tracked.  Toggling off <code>org-remark-mode</code> stops this tracking completely, which will likely result in inconsistency between the marginal notes file and the current source buffer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Command <code>org-remark-change</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Change the highlight at point to one by another pen. This command will show you a list of available pens to choose from.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>To navigate through highlights in the current buffer, you can use <code>org-remark-view-next</code> / <code>org-remark-view-prev</code> or the following pair of commands. The former moves your cursor and displays the marginal notes buffer; the latter only moves your cursor.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>Command <code>org-remark-next</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Move to the next highlight, if any.
If there is none below the point but there is a highlight in the buffer, cycle back to the first one.
After the point has moved to the next highlight, this command lets you move further by re-entering only the last letter like this example:  &lsquo;<samp>C-n ] ] ] ] ]</samp>&rsquo; (assuming this command is bound to C-n ])

<p>To create this package, I was inspired by the following packages. I did not copy any part of them, but borrowed some ideas from them &ndash; e.g. saving the margin notes in a separate file.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/ov-highlight">Ov-highlight</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>John Kitchin&rsquo;s (author of Org-ref). Great UX for markers with hydra. Saves the marker info and comments directly within the Org file as Base64 encoded string. It uses overlays with using <code>ov</code> package.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><a href="https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el">Annotate.el</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Bastian Bechtold&rsquo;s (author of Org-journal). Unique display of annotations right next to (or on top of) the text. It seems to be designed for very short annotations, and perhaps for code review (programming practice); I have seen recent issues reported when used with variable-pitch fonts (prose).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><a href="https://github.com/tkf/org-mode/blob/master/contrib/lisp/org-annotate-file.el">Org-annotate-file</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Part of Org&rsquo;s contrib library. It seems to be designed to annotate a whole file in a separate Org file, rather than specific text items.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><a href="https://github.com/IdoMagal/ipa.el">InPlaceAnnotations (ipa-mode)</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>It looks similar to Annotate.el above.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Transient navigation feature</span></dt>
<dd><p>To implement the transient navigation feature, I liberally copied the relevant code from a wonderful Emacs package, <a href="https://github.com/rnkn/binder/blob/24d55db236fea2b405d4bdc69b4c33d0f066059c/binder.el#L658-L665">Binder</a> by Paul W.

</div>

<div class="display">
<pre class="display">Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org/</a>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre></div>

<ol start="0">
<li> PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li><li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.
</p>
<p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li><li> RELICENSING

<p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

<span id="ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents"></span><h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with&hellip;Texts.&rdquo; line with this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
